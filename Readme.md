# Advent of Code 2022

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

## Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization
>One Elf has the important job of loading all of the rucksacks with supplies for the jungle journey. Unfortunately, that Elf didn't quite follow the packing instructions, and so a few items now need to be rearranged.

I'm not really sure why this one gave me such a hard time.  There's definitely a better way to solve this, but I'm done for the night.
